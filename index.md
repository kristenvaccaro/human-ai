# Human-AI Interaction: Spring 2021

This course provides an introduction to harnessing the power of AI so that it benefits people and communities. Topics will include: agency and initiative, fairness and bias, transparency and explainability, confidence and errors, and privacy, ethics, and trust. Students will build a number of interactive technologies powered by AI, gain practical experience with what makes them more or less usable, and learn to evaluate their impact on individuals and communities. Students will learn to think critically (but also optimistically) about what AI systems can do and how they should be integrated into society.

## Inclusion Statement
It is my hope that we will develop a supportive learning community that will foster rich discussions through the sharing of personal ideas, experiences, and interpretations of the course material. Honesty, listening for understanding, a willingness to share your ideas, and respect for self and others are basic guidelines that can help create a positive learning environment. Your participation and feedback is important to the success of the course and I welcome your thoughts throughout the semester on how we might improve class processes that will encourage effective communication and dialogue.

## Student Support & Resources
Graduate and undergraduate work can be very challenging for a number of reasons: research often lacks clear direction and goals, graduate students are not well compensated for their work, and there are often unclear boundaries between your professional and your personal, family, and social lives. I encourage you particularly in the unusually challenging time we are all experiencing now due to COVID-19 to devote time and energy to all of your needs. If you could use help on any of those dimensions (your scholarly, physical, or psychological well-being), UCSD has a number of resources, [some which can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JgATnpJ6di513Pe_CqdOoSDaer_h6jz7oRQn7fZYNrA/edit).

I am committed (as is UCSD) to full inclusion in education for all persons. Services and reasonable accommodations are available to students with temporary and permanent disabilities, to students with DACA or undocumented status, to students with health or other personal concerns, and to students with other kinds of support needs. Please feel free to let me know if there are circumstances that emerge that affect your ability to contribute to the class.
