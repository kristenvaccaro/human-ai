# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do I need to submit a course clearance request through EASy?

According to the department:
`The enrollment system is not set up to allow us to have varying prerequisites for our CSE 190 sections. It views CSE 190 as the same course. So all CSE 190's require department approval and we manually have to look for prerequisites. Since your section has no prereq's, we would just issue the clearance. Whereas other CSE 190's, we have to manually verify the students have completed them before issuing the clearance needed.
