# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do I need to submit a course clearance request through EASy?

According to the department:
> The enrollment system is not set up to allow us to have varying prerequisites for our CSE 190 sections. It views CSE 190 as the same course. So all CSE 190's require department approval and we manually have to look for prerequisites. Since your section has no prerequisites, we would just issue the clearance. But for other CSE 190's, we have to manually verify the students have completed them before issuing the clearance needed.

### If my EASy application is approved, am I guaranteed a spot in the class?

No. Again, according to the department:  
> An EASy approval does NOT guarantee a spot in the course.  
The caps for courses are handled in the registration system (not EASy), so you will need to register as in any other course with a limited number of seats. 

### Will this course be offered again?

Yes, this course is likely to be offered every year. 

### Are there requirements for synchronous participation? 

I strongly encourage you to attend the synchronous sessions to get the most out of the class. Since this course will be offered in the future, you may prefer to wait until future quarters to take it. That said, due to COVID-19 for the Spring 2021 offering all lecture/discussion classes (Mondays and Wednesdays) will be recorded and made available on Canvas. For the final project, you can either: find a group that is willing to meet outside of the Friday design studios (and/or coordinate asynchronous contributions) or choose the alternate (writing) activity.
