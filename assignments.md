# Assignments

There will be four forms of assessment over the quarter: quizzes, programming assignments, a group project, and a final exam. All deadlines are given in PT.

## Quizzes

You will complete quizzes before each Monday and Wednesday class. These quizzes will evaluate your understanding of the reading assigned for that day's class.  

Quizzes will be due at 2PM, before the start of class.  
Quizzes will be assigned on Canvas.
Your lowest quiz score will be dropped automatically. 

## Programming Assignments

You will complete four programming assignments over the course of the quarter. These programming assignments will help you understand and apply the concepts we talk about in class. 

Programming assignments will be due at 5PM Friday, every other week: Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8.
